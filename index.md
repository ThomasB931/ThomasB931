### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was my favorite because my partner programmed a Hi and Low game which is a guessing game where someone has a secret number and the guesser has to guess the same number. This project was really fun to do because it reminded me of my childhood friends.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was my favorite because Black Jack is my favorite card game to play and it was difficult to program. But in the end, coding is about problem-solving so I like having a challenge.

* Lab 8 

    Lab 8, part 1 was my favorite because it was a word game that involved using sentences with blanks. Players fill in the blanks in amusing ways and weird ways too. It also helps me gain more experience with coding and learn from my mistakes while doing programming.
